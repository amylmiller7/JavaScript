**Source description:** Project that builds Udemy Coding for Writers final project. Extended functionality beyond items learned in course or required for final project

**Summary:** Creates a therapist bot that user interacts with by typing comments into text box. Therapist bot responds to user's input.
 
**JS:** Uses constant arrays to house therapist responses. Outputs user input and random therapist responses to web page. User input processed upon clicking Submit button or hitting Return. Clears text box after user input has been output to web page.

Checks user input for the following: no input, ends in question mark or exclamation point, in all upper case letters, or contains first person words. Responds to user input based on what is found. Replaces user input that contains first person words with second person words, changes first word to lower case, and adds this modified user input to a random therapist question.

As user and therapist conversation fills a set window size, automatically scrolls to the bottom of the therapy session window so user can view latest messages.
